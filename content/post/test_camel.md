Steps I used to create this post:


1. Opened existing project
2. Rendered existing project from VMM
3. Created a video in after effects
4. Uploaded all of the project folder to Google Drive.  And then delete all the rendered files.
5. Opened the .mp4 on my phone and uploaded to instagram.
6. Go through the instagram options to pub.  Notify twitter
7. Create a git repo of my work folder.
8. Create the .gitignore to exclude big files. 
9. push repo to git
10. create a new hugo post for 20181115_snowyBoots
11. find a suitable image to use as the posterframe. 
12. edit the post (start creating this list)
13. tried to get the image to show up
14. found out that the folder you create if you use post folder image CAN'T be camelCase
15. If you want to open a link in a new window you need to use html
